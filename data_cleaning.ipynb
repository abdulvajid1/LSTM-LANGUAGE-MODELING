      "{'text': \"In 1793 Zaman Shah, a grandson of Ahmad Shah Durrani, won a brief war of succession to become ruler of Afghanistan. The support of Painda Khan, chief of the Baraksai branch of the Durrani tribe, was decisive in his victory. In the next fifty year., the brothers of Zaman shah and the sons of Painda Khan were to dominate the affairs of Afghanistan. The Durrani tribe was very large with several branches and numerous clans. 1 Abmad Shah and his successors belonged to the Sadozai clan, but other clans, such as the Mohammedzai of Painda Khan, were larger and more powerful and this situation caused many problems.\\nMahmud had revolted unsuccessfully several times with Persian backing, but now with Fateh Khan's help he was able to defeat Zaman who was captured and blinded. Mahmud's position was insecure however. Persian invasions threatened, the tribes were discontented, and another brother of Zaman, Shuja-ul-Mulk, was in arms against him. In 1803 Shuja succeeded in toppling Mahmud after three years in power. But Shuja's rule was effective only in Kabul and Peshawar since Mahmud's brother Firuz held Herat, and Fateh Khan controUed the country around Kandahar. Mahmud escaped from the prison where he had been confined and in 1809 he and Fateh Khan defeated Shuja, who eventually fled to India where he was given a pension by the British, and Mabmud returned to power.\\nDuring his years in power Fateh Khan had made many enemies including Mabmud's son Kamran, and most recently Firuz. At this point Fath Ali Shah of Persia sent Mahmud an ultimatum to dispose of Fateh Khan or face a massive Persian invasion. 5 These combined factors, persuaded Mahmud to sacrifice his vizier. Fateh Khan was seized, blinded, kept prisoner, and finally cut to pieces in 1818. 6 Like Zaman, Mabmud had destroyed the man who was keeping him on the throne and his fall was equally swift. Fateh Khan's brothers led a general revolt and assumed control themselves while Mabmud, Kamran, and Firuz fled to Herat.\\nThese continued civil wars and the division of royal authority were disastrous for Afghanistan. Herat was cast adrift and now isolated and surrounded by enemies. On the west, the Persians were eager to make good their long-standing claim to the city. On the east, only the disunity of Fateh Khan's brothers prevented them from avenging him. Herat might have fallen to either one if it had not first begun to arouse the interest of outside powers.\", 'meta': {'redpajama_set_name': 'RedPajamaC4'}}\n"
